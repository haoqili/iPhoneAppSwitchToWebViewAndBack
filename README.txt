A simple iOS 5.0 app with 2 views, each with a button to go to the other view. One of the views displays a webpage. So there is a home view with button to redirect to a web page view, which has a back to home button.

It is based on these two tutorials:

SwitchView: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdiY64KFRKs
UIWebView: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T82qvs3hmf0
(note you can easily add back/forward/refresh buttons for the webview)

Built on Xcode 4.2
